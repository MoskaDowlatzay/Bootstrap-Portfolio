# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my homework for module 3, which is creating a bootstrap portfolio. My portfolio includes links to my git hub portfolio and my linkedin I have tried to ,make it responsive.

## Notes

I have used placeholders for the 3 cards and used rubbish repos as I am new to web developing so I don't have much of a portfolio.
